This script will read the usernames and passwords in the "names_and_pass.txt" and then store if the login was succesful into the log.txt file. __

# Execution: __ 
Execute the python file. __
You can adjust username and passwords in the names_and_pass.txt file, format:  __
{USERNAME} {PASSWORD} __ 
One username and password per line. __

Log file will not be cleared every run, as it just appends all logins. __

# Waring: __
This script will open a brower and go to the website automatically, (it can take up to 5-8 seconds for the webpage to first load) it is best to not touch your mouse/keyboard until the script is complete. __
