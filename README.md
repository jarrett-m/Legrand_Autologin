# IMPORTANT!

# Prerequisite:
pip install webbot  
pip uninstall selenium
pip install selenium==3.141.0
A recent version of google chrome.

This script will read the usernames and passwords in the "names_and_pass.txt" and then store if the login was succesful into the log.txt file.

# Execution:  
Execute the python file
You can adjust username and passwords in the names_and_pass.txt file, format:
{USERNAME} {PASSWORD}
One username and password per line.

Log file will not be cleared every run, as it just appends all logins.

# Waring:
This script will open a brower and go to the website automatically, (it can take up to 5-8 seconds for the webpage to first load) it is best to not touch your mouse/keyboard until the script is complete.

Thank you for considering me as a canidate :) this was a lot of fun and have not really done anything like this before!
